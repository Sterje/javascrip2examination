    description: `Hello, my name is Jesper Eriksson Stenberg. I'm studying at KYH to become a Front-End Developer. I started making websites in the late '90s when the Internet started growing in popularity, and when a visitor's counter was the most important thing on your site.
  
    After many years of working at ICA, I decided it was time for a change and revisited my old interest in building websites. In fact, a major reason I started thinking about it again was when ICA released a new mobile-first, web-based system. It was such a leap forward for the employees in the stores.
  
    So much has happened with the web and technology since I first started building websites in the '90s.
  
    As of now, I have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.`,
