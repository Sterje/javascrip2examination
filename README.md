Javascrip 2 Examination

In this project I'm using React to build att SPA webpage about myself and my abilities.

Im using React Redux to change the theme of the website. The user can change between a light or dark theme that applies to the whole site.

Im using useState to change the state of the menu in mobile view.

I'm using props to send data from userInfo to About page.

Right now I'm having some trouble with GH-Pages.
